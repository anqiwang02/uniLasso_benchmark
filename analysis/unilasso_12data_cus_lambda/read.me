This folder is for analysis of the 12 datasets with custom lambda grid instead of using the default lambda grid in cv.glmnet

1. unilasso_12data_loop_cus_lambda.R: For 100 random splits of the 12 datasets with custom lambda values and caculate the 4 metrics (MSE, support size, # violations)
2. unilasso_12data_ownlambda_coef.R: Calculate the coefficient estimates for different methods in the 12 datasets with custom lambda values, and these coefficients are used to calculate the random-split stability values
3. unilasso_12data_cuslambda_bootstrap.R: For 100 bootstrap samples from the fixed training set, we calcualte the two new performance metrics using the bootstrap based technique (bootstrap stability and prediction interval)

For generating the figures from the results of the above three scripts, please refer to the R markdown file unilasso_12data_cus_lambda_final_graph_v3.Rmd
