This folder is for analysis of the 12 datasets with default lambda grid in cv.glmnet

1. unilasso_12data_100_ran_split.R: For 100 random splits of the 12 datasets with default lambda values and caculate the 4 metrics (MSE, support size, # violations)
2. unilasso_12data_coef.R: Calculate the coefficient estimates for different methods in the 12 datasets with default lambda values, and these coefficients are used to calculate the random-split stability values
3. unilasso_12data_100bootstrap.R: For 100 bootstrap samples from the fixed training set, we calcualte the two new performance metrics using the bootstrap based technique (bootstrap stability and prediction interval)
4. unilasso_12data_100ran_split_add1method.R includes an additional UniLasso method without sign constraint (uniLasso-nosign)
5. unilasso_12data_cross_methods_similarity.Rmd: the final metric (pair-wise similarity between different methods) is calculated in this R markdown file; it is based on using one single train/test split

For generating the figures from the results of the above three scripts, please refer to the R markdown file unilasso_12data_graph_v3.Rmd
