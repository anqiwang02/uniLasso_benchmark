1. unilasso_22data_100ran_split.R: For 100 random splits of the 12 datasets with default lambda values and caculate the 4 metrics (MSE, support size, # violations)
2. unilasso_22data_coef.R: Calculate the coefficient estimates for different methods in the 12 datasets with default lambda values, and these coefficients are used to calculate the random-split stability values
3. unilasso_22data_100bootstrap.R: For 100 bootstrap samples from the fixed training set, we calcualte the two new performance metrics using the bootstrap based technique (bootstrap stability and prediction interval)
